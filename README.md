# Project 3 - Custom Interpreter

## Project Description

The project provides an implementation of an interpreter for a custom language.

## Organization

The code is organized into a source directory (`src/`) and a header directory
(`include/`). Each component or activity required by the interpreter is located
in its own set of a `c` source file and a `c` header file and have the same
names.

For instance, `src/parse.c` and `include/parse.h` contain the implementation
of the parsing module and its provided API.

The entry point of the unit testing and integration testing programs are
located in `src/test.c`, while the entry point of the fuzzing programs are
located in `src/fuzz.c`.

The `fuzz/` directory contains the initial seeds for a fuzzing run, and will
contain a temporary directory when fuzzing.

The `test/` directory contains various assets used for integration testing of
the `lisp` program.

The `submissions/` directory will contain assets related to the submission of
various sprints.

The `build/` directory will contain the object files and linked programs
produced by the build process.

## Build Process

### Prerequisites

In order to build the interpreter, the following programs must be installed:
`GNU make` and `gcc`.

The prerequisites to build the unit testing and integration testing programs
are identical to the ones required to build the interpreter.

In order to fuzz the interpreter, the following additional programs must be
installed:
`afl++` and `tmux`.

### Building

To build the interpreter, run:
```bash
make
```

To build the unit testing and integration testing programs, run:
```bash
make build-test
```

To build the fuzzing programs, run:
```bash
make build-fuzz
```

## Testing

To run the unit and integration tests, run:
```bash
make test
```

To fuzz the interpreter, run:
```bash
make fuzz
```
